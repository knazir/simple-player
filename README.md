# simple-player
This is an implementation of a simple media player in Java. I will be working on trying to expand the features of this project over time as it is my first attempt at something that somewhat resembles a real piece of software.

I don't know why, but I've always had this strange dream of gradually letting my obsession with filling programs with features upon features lead to the creation of a legitimate piece of software. Whatever that's supposed to mean...

Currently, it is a bare-bones media player with the minimum functionality of playing a pre-determined video (soon to be fixed) and being able to change the volume and skip to a given time in the video.
